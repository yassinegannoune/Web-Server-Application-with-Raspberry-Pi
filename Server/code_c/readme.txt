in this part i build my own driver for dht11 temperature acquisition but
due to some problems in read and configure the input and output for specefic range time 
it gives sametimes uncorrect values.
that why we used the library wiring pi to compare between the two of them .
both dht11_c and test_code work correctly but the one that use the predefined library is more powerfull
